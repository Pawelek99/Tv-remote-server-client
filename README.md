## Description

Application used to control your Android TV remotely. Devices can be connected using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
Whole project is based on the library I found [here](https://github.com/manishvwynk/TestRemoteDemo/blob/master/app/libs/google-android-tv-support-remote-2388371.jar).

## Functionality

Beside basic cursor movements you can control your volume using physical volume buttons and navigate back with your back button.
Additionally TV Remote allows you to change the input source (displaying possible inputs on the TV) or open an application from the list displayed at the top of the screen (such as Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, Tidal or Google Play Store).

If you just want to toggle the power of your TV there's also a Quick Tile at your service.

## Design

Whole project is designed and created by me. Check out Figma project of the UI [here](https://www.figma.com/file/fwcjwwJCKP1E6Rwz8VEKjj/Tv-remote?node-id=0%3A1)
